An open source toolkit for sharing knowledge about how to do co-design led by community members and organizations.

## Community-led co-design

Community-led co-design is an approach in which the co-design process, not just the outcomes, is developed in
collaboration with community members who will be directly impacted by the design.

Community-led co-design:

* Recognizes and leverages community leadership
* Uses a familiar and comfortable environment
* Creates more engaged communities
* Moves from design _with_ to design _by_
